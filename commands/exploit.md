Attempt exploitation of: $ARGUMENTS

Current findings:
!`nyx-memory notes_read findings 2>/dev/null || echo "No findings yet — run /recon or /scan first"`

Current credentials:
!`nyx-memory notes_read credentials 2>/dev/null || echo "No credentials yet"`

## Pre-Exploitation Checklist

1. **Confirm scope** — is this target and attack vector authorized?
2. **Research the vulnerability** — check `searchsploit`, CVE databases, known PoCs via web search
3. **Assess impact risk** — could this crash the service or cause data loss?
4. **Prepare rollback** — know how to restore if something breaks
5. **Set up capture** — have listeners, logging, and evidence collection ready

## Exploitation Workflow

1. **Prepare** — configure exploit, set payloads, start listeners
2. **Execute** — run the exploit wrapped in `nyx-log` for command logging
3. **Verify access** — confirm what level of access was obtained
4. **Document immediately**:
   - `finding_update` to mark the finding as exploited with proof
   - `credential_add` for any obtained credentials (passwords, hashes, tokens, keys) — include source, access level, and verification status
   - `host_update` on the target host with exploitation details in the exploitation section
   - `evidence_save` for exploit output, shell screenshots, proof of access
   - `attack_path_update` to add this step to the attack narrative
5. **Stabilize** — upgrade shell if needed, migrate process, ensure persistence of session

## Post-Exploitation Triage

Immediately after gaining access, collect:
- Identity: `whoami`, `id`, `hostname`
- System: OS version, architecture, patch level
- Network: interfaces, routes, ARP table, connections, DNS config
- Quick privesc check: `sudo -l`, SUID binaries, or `whoami /priv` on Windows
- Accessible credentials: config files, history files, environment variables, cached tokens
- Connected networks: anything reachable from this host that wasn't from our original position

Use `host_update` to record all post-exploitation findings in the post-exploitation section of the host file.

## If Exploitation Fails

- `dead_end_log` to record what was tried and why it failed
- Analyze the failure: wrong version, patched, WAF/IPS blocked, missing dependency
- Suggest alternative approaches or different attack vectors
- `todo_add` for alternative exploitation ideas
