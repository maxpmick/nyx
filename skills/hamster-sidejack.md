# hamster-sidejack

## Overview
Hamster is a sidejacking tool that acts as a local HTTP proxy. It works in tandem with a sniffer (traditionally `ferret`) to capture session cookies from the network. When a user browses through the Hamster proxy, it automatically replaces the user's cookies with the stolen session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim's authenticated session. Category: Sniffing & Spoofing / Web Application Testing.

## Installation (if not already installed)

Assume hamster-sidejack is already installed. If you get a "command not found" error:

```bash
sudo apt install hamster-sidejack
```

Note: You typically need `ferret-sidejack` to sniff the cookies that Hamster uses.

## Common Workflows

### Basic Sidejacking Setup
1. Start the sniffer (e.g., ferret) to capture cookies into a file (usually `hamster.txt`).
2. Start hamster:
```bash
hamster
```
3. Configure your web browser to use `http://127.0.0.1:1234` as its HTTP proxy.
4. Navigate to `http://hamster` in your browser to manage captured sessions and select a target.

### Running on a specific interface (via ferret)
While hamster itself acts as the proxy, the data it serves is populated by the sniffer. Ensure ferret is running:
```bash
ferret -i eth0
```
Then run hamster to process the resulting data.

## Complete Command Reference

Hamster is primarily controlled via its web interface once launched.

### Command Line Usage
```bash
hamster
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| (No flags) | Starts the hamster proxy server on the default port (1234) |

### Runtime Configuration
Once the binary is running, it provides the following operational details:
- **Proxy Address**: `http://127.0.0.1:1234`
- **Management Interface**: `http://hamster` (accessible only when browsing through the proxy)

### Files
- **hamster.txt**: The default file hamster looks for to read sniffed session cookies (generated by ferret).

## Notes
- **Encryption**: Hamster only works against unencrypted HTTP traffic. It cannot sidejack sessions protected by HTTPS/TLS unless SSL stripping (like `sslstrip`) is used successfully beforehand.
- **Browser Configuration**: You must manually set your browser's proxy settings to `127.0.0.1` on port `1234` for the tool to function.
- **Dependencies**: Hamster relies on `ferret` (or a compatible sniffer) to generate the `hamster.txt` file containing captured cookie data.
