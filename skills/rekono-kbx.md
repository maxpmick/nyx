description: Automate penetration testing processes by combining multiple hacking tools into orchestrated workflows. Use when performing automated reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, or full-cycle pentesting where results need to be consolidated and sent via Telegram, Email, or imported into Defect-Dojo.

# rekono-kbx

## Overview
Rekono is an automation platform that orchestrates various hacking tools to complete complex pentesting processes against a target. It centralizes findings and supports notifications via Email or Telegram, and integrates with Defect-Dojo for vulnerability management. This package is distributed as a Kaboxer (Kali Applications Boxer) container. Category: Reconnaissance / Information Gathering / Vulnerability Analysis.

## Installation (if not already installed)
The tool is typically pre-installed on Kali Linux. If missing, ensure Docker is functional as it is a primary dependency.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rekono-kbx
```

**Dependencies:**
* docker.io or docker-ce
* kaboxer

## Common Workflows

### Start the Rekono Service
Since Rekono is a web-based automation platform managed via Kaboxer, you start the service to access the interface:
```bash
rekono run
```
After running, access the web interface (usually on port 8080 or as specified in the output) to configure targets and workflows.

### Stop the Rekono Service
To stop the running containerized instance:
```bash
rekono stop
```

### Check Service Status
To verify if the Rekono container is running and view its details:
```bash
rekono status
```

## Complete Command Reference

Rekono is managed via the `rekono` command (provided by the `rekono-kbx` package), which interfaces with Kaboxer to manage the application lifecycle.

### Global Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rekono run` | Start the Rekono application and its associated services (database, workers). |
| `rekono stop` | Stop the Rekono application services. |
| `rekono status` | Show the current status of the Rekono container and services. |
| `rekono restart` | Restart the Rekono application services. |
| `rekono logs` | View the logs generated by the Rekono application. |
| `rekono delete` | Remove the Rekono container and its associated data. |
| `rekono help` | Display help information for the command line interface. |

## Notes
- **Automation:** Rekono relies on "Tools" (individual scanners like Nmap, Dirsearch, etc.) and "Workflows" (sequences of tools).
- **Notifications:** Configuration for Telegram bots and Email SMTP must be done within the Rekono web interface after the service is started.
- **Integration:** To use Defect-Dojo integration, you will need the API URL and API Key from your Defect-Dojo instance.
- **Containerization:** Because it runs in a Kaboxer container, ensure your user has permissions to run Docker commands (usually by being in the `docker` group).
