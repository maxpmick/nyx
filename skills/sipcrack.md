# sipcrack

## Overview
sipcrack is a suite of tools designed to sniff and crack digest authentications within the SIP protocol. It consists of two main utilities: `sipdump` for capturing or extracting authentication data, and `sipcrack` for performing brute-force attacks against the captured data. Category: Password Attacks / VoIP.

## Installation (if not already installed)
Assume the tool is already installed. If the commands are missing:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sipcrack
```

## Common Workflows

### Capture SIP authentications from a live interface
```bash
sudo sipdump -i eth0 sip_captures.txt
```
Listens on `eth0` and writes any captured SIP digest authentications to `sip_captures.txt`.

### Extract SIP authentications from a pcap file
```bash
sipdump -p capture.pcap dump.txt
```
Processes an existing pcap file and saves the relevant login data for cracking.

### Crack captured hashes using a wordlist
```bash
sipcrack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt dump.txt
```
Attempts to brute-force the passwords in `dump.txt` using the specified wordlist.

### Crack using piped input (stdin)
```bash
john --incremental --stdout | sipcrack -s dump.txt
```
Uses passwords generated by another tool (like John the Ripper) via stdin.

## Complete Command Reference

### sipdump
Used to capture SIP digest authentications and write them to a dump file.

```
Usage: sipdump [OPTIONS] <dump file>
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<dump file>` | File where captured logins will be written to |
| `-i <interface>` | Interface to listen on for live capture |
| `-p <file>` | Use a pcap data file instead of live capture |
| `-m` | Enter login data manually |
| `-f "<filter>"` | Set a custom libpcap filter (e.g., "port 5060") |

### sipcrack
Used to brute-force the user password using the dump file generated by `sipdump`.

```
Usage: sipcrack [OPTIONS] [ -s | -w <wordlist> ] <dump file>
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<dump file>` | File containing logins sniffed by SIPdump |
| `-s` | Use stdin for passwords |
| `-w <wordlist>` | File containing all passwords to try |
| `-p <num>` | Print cracking process every `n` passwords (Note: slows down performance significantly) |

## Notes
- SIP typically uses port 5060 (UDP/TCP) or 5061 (TLS). `sipdump` focuses on unencrypted SIP digest authentication.
- If using `-p` with `sipcrack`, be aware that high values or frequent updates will heavily impact the speed of the cracking process.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions (sudo) when capturing from a live network interface.
