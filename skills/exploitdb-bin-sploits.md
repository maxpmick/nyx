name: exploitdb-bin-sploits
description: Access and manage the Exploit Database's archive of binary exploits. Use when looking for pre-compiled exploit payloads, proof-of-concept binaries, or shellcode that cannot be represented in plain text. This is a local repository of binary assets often referenced by searchsploit or the Exploit-DB web interface.

# exploitdb-bin-sploits

## Overview
This package provides a local archive of binary exploits from The Exploit Database (Exploit-DB). While most exploits in Exploit-DB are scripts (Python, Ruby, C source), some require pre-compiled binaries or specific non-text assets to function. Category: Exploitation.

## Installation (if not already installed)
The package is large (~1GB) and contains the binary assets.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install exploitdb-bin-sploits
```

## Common Workflows

### Locating a binary exploit
Binary exploits are typically identified via `searchsploit`. Once you have the path from searchsploit, you can find the corresponding binary in the local directory.

```bash
# Example: Finding the path to a binary exploit
searchsploit -p 12345
# If the path points to /bin-sploits/, navigate to the local directory:
ls -l /usr/share/exploitdb-bin-sploits/bin-sploits/
```

### Browsing the archive
You can manually browse the directory structure to see available binary payloads.

```bash
ls -R /usr/share/exploitdb-bin-sploits/bin-sploits/
```

## Complete Command Reference

The package primarily installs a directory structure at `/usr/share/exploitdb-bin-sploits/`. There is no complex CLI; it is a data repository.

### Directory Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/usr/share/exploitdb-bin-sploits/` | Root directory for the binary exploit archive |
| `/usr/share/exploitdb-bin-sploits/bin-sploits/` | Subdirectory containing the actual binary files and assets |

### Usage via searchsploit
While `exploitdb-bin-sploits` is the data package, it is most commonly interacted with via the `searchsploit` command (part of the `exploitdb` package).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `searchsploit --path [EDB-ID]` | Shows the full path to an exploit, including those in the bin-sploits directory |
| `searchsploit -m [EDB-ID]` | Copies the exploit (including binaries if applicable) to the current working directory |

## Notes
- This package is a dependency for a full offline Exploit-DB experience.
- Binary exploits should always be executed in a controlled, isolated environment (sandbox/VM) as they are untrusted code by nature.
- The files are organized by their Exploit-DB ID or category as mirrored from the official site.
