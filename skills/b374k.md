# b374k

## Overview
b374k is a remote management tool packaged as a single PHP file. It provides a web-based interface for system administration and post-exploitation tasks without requiring SSH or FTP access. It features a file manager, SQL explorer, process manager, and network tools. Category: Exploitation / Post-Exploitation.

## Installation (if not already installed)
The tool is typically pre-installed on Kali Linux. If missing:

```bash
sudo apt install b374k
```
Dependencies: `kali-defaults`, `php-cli`.

## Common Workflows

### Generate a custom webshell file
To create a standalone PHP shell with a specific password and output it to your current directory:
```bash
php /usr/share/b374k/index.php -o shell.php -p mypassword
```

### Generate a shell with specific modules and theme
```bash
php /usr/share/b374k/index.php -o custom_shell.php -p secret -m network,sql -t black
```

### Accessing the shell
1. Upload the generated `.php` file to the target web server.
2. Navigate to the file via a web browser (e.g., `http://target.com/shell.php`).
3. Login using the password defined during generation.

## Complete Command Reference

The b374k package in Kali provides a generator script located at `/usr/share/b374k/index.php` to create the single-file shell.

```bash
php /usr/share/b374k/index.php [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-o <filename>` | Specify the output filename for the generated PHP shell |
| `-p <password>` | Set the login password for the webshell |
| `-m <modules>` | Select specific modules to include (comma separated). Available: `file`, `terminal`, `eval`, `network`, `sql`, `process`, `mail`, `string`, `info` |
| `-t <theme>` | Set the UI theme (e.g., `default`, `black`, `blue`, `green`) |
| `-c <compression>`| Set compression level for the output file (0-9) |
| `-h` | Display help and version information |

### Features Available within the Web Interface
Once the shell is deployed and accessed via a browser, the following capabilities are available:

*   **File Manager**: View, edit, rename, delete, upload, download, and archive files.
*   **Search**: Search for files, folders, or specific file content (supports Regex).
*   **Command Execution**: Execute system shell commands.
*   **Script Execution**: Run code in PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js, or C.
*   **Network Tools**: Establish Bind Shells or Reverse Shells; Simple packet crafter.
*   **DBMS Connectivity**: Connect to MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, SQLite, PostgreSQL (via ODBC or PDO).
*   **SQL Explorer**: Browse and query connected databases.
*   **Process List**: View and manage running system processes (Task Manager).
*   **Email**: Send emails with attachments (including local files from the server).
*   **String Conversion**: Encode/decode strings (Base64, Hex, etc.).

## Notes
*   **Security**: The generated shell is a powerful backdoor. Always use a strong password (`-p`) to prevent unauthorized access by third parties.
*   **Stealth**: The shell is contained in a single file, making it easier to deploy and harder to detect than multi-file kits, but it may be flagged by AV/EDR solutions or Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
*   **Environment**: Requires a PHP environment on the target server to execute.
