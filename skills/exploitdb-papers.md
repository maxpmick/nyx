# exploitdb-papers

## Overview
The `exploitdb-papers` package provides a massive offline repository of security papers and ezines curated by The Exploit Database (Exploit-DB). It contains technical documentation, research papers, and historical security publications. Category: Exploitation / Vulnerability Analysis.

## Installation (if not already installed)
The tool is typically pre-installed on Kali Linux. If the directory `/usr/share/exploitdb-papers` is missing:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install exploitdb-papers
```

## Common Workflows

### Browsing the archive
Since this is a data package rather than an interactive binary, you navigate the filesystem to find papers:
```bash
ls -R /usr/share/exploitdb-papers/papers
```

### Searching for specific topics
Use `grep` or `find` to search for specific keywords within the paper titles or contents:
```bash
find /usr/share/exploitdb-papers/ -name "*buffer-overflow*"
```

### Reading a specific paper
Once a file is located, use a pager or browser to read it:
```bash
cat /usr/share/exploitdb-papers/papers/english/12345-some-paper.txt
# Or for PDF/HTML files
xdg-open /usr/share/exploitdb-papers/papers/english/12345-some-paper.pdf
```

## Complete Command Reference

The `exploitdb-papers` command is a simple wrapper that displays the location of the archive. The primary interaction is via the filesystem.

### Directory Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|

| `-h` | Display the help message and the path to the archive |

## Notes
- This package is quite large (approx. 2.74 GB) as it contains a significant historical archive of security research.
- Papers are often organized by language and category within the subdirectories.
- For searching exploits (code) rather than papers (documentation), use the `searchsploit` tool which is part of the `exploitdb` package.
