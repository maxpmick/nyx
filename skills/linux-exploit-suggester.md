# linux-exploit-suggester

## Overview
Linux Exploit Suggester (LES) is a privilege escalation auditing tool designed to detect security deficiencies in Linux-based machines. It assesses kernel exposure to exploits using heuristic methods and verifies both compile-time (CONFIGs) and run-time (sysctl) kernel hardening settings. Category: Post-Exploitation / Vulnerability Analysis.

## Installation (if not already installed)
The tool is typically pre-installed in Kali Linux. If missing:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install linux-exploit-suggester
```

Note: The script is often located at `/usr/share/linux-exploit-suggester/Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl`.

## Common Workflows

### Audit the local running system
```bash
/usr/share/linux-exploit-suggester/Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl
```

### Check exploits for a specific kernel version
```bash
/usr/share/linux-exploit-suggester/Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl -k 3.0.0
```

### Check kernel hardening measures
```bash
/usr/share/linux-exploit-suggester/Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl --checksec
```

### Remote audit (manual input)
If you have the `uname -a` output from a target, you can provide the version string:
```bash
/usr/share/linux-exploit-suggester/Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl -u "Linux target 4.4.0-21-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 18 18:33:37 UTC 2016 x86_64 GNU/Linux"
```

### General Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-k, --kernel <version>` | Specify the kernel version to check against (e.g., 3.2.0) |
| `-u, --uname <string>` | Provide a full `uname -a` string for analysis |
| `--checksec` | Verify kernel hardening security measures (compile-time and run-time) |
| `-h, --help` | Display help information |
| `--list` | List all exploits currently in the LES database |
| `--short` | Display only the names of possible exploits |

### Filtering Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--cve <CVE-ID>` | Search for a specific CVE in the database |
| `--pkg <package>` | Filter results based on specific distribution packages |

## Notes
- **Heuristics**: LES uses heuristic methods to calculate exposure; a "Possible Exploit" result does not guarantee success but indicates a high probability of vulnerability.
- **Hardening Check**: The `--checksec` functionality is a modern continuation of the `--kernel` switch from the original `checksec.sh` tool.
- **Environment**: While the tool is written in Perl, it is designed to be portable. If running on a restricted target, you may need to upload the standalone `.pl` script.
