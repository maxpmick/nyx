name: xplico
description: Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) used to extract application data from internet traffic captures. It reconstructs emails (POP, IMAP, SMTP), HTTP content, VoIP calls (SIP, MGCP, H323), FTP, and TFTP sessions from PCAP files or live interfaces. Use during digital forensics, incident response, or network traffic analysis to visualize and recover high-level protocol data rather than just analyzing raw packets.

# xplico

## Overview
Xplico is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) designed to extract application-layer data from network traffic. Unlike a standard protocol analyzer, Xplico focuses on reconstructing the actual content (files, emails, audio) transmitted over the network. Category: Digital Forensics / Incident Response.

## Installation (if not already installed)
Assume Xplico is already installed. If not:
```bash
sudo apt install xplico
```

## Common Workflows

### Start the Web Interface
Most users interact with Xplico via its web-based dashboard.
```bash
sudo xplico-webui
```
Access the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:9876`.

### Live Traffic Analysis
Analyze traffic in real-time on a specific interface (e.g., eth0) using the Real Time Module (rltm).
```bash
sudo xplico -m rltm -i eth0
```

### Extract Packets Around a Trigger
Use `trigcap` to isolate specific packets from a large PCAP file based on a trigger packet number, including context before and after.
```bash
trigcap -f input.pcap -t 500 -b 10 -a 20 -o trigger_context.pcap
```

### Stop Xplico Services
```bash
sudo xplico-webui-stop
```

## Complete Command Reference

### xplico (CLI)
The main engine for decoding traffic. **Note: Parameters MUST respect the order shown below.**

```bash
xplico [-v] [-c <config_file>] [-h] [-s] [-g] [-l] [-i <prot>] -m <capture_module>
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v` | Display version |
| `-c <config_file>` | Specify path to configuration file |
| `-h` | Display help |
| `-i <prot>` | Display info of protocol 'prot' |
| `-g` | Display graph-tree of protocols |
| `-l` | Print all logs to the screen |
| `-s` | Print decoding status every second |
| `-m <module>` | Specify capture type module (e.g., `rltm` for real-time) |

### trigcap
A utility to extract a subset of packets from a PCAP file.

```bash
trigcap [-v] -f <input_file> -t <pkt_num> -b <before> -a <after> -o <output_file> [-h]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v` | Display version |
| `-f <file>` | Input PCAP file |
| `-t <num>` | Trigger packet number |
| `-b <num>` | Number of packets to include before the trigger |
| `-a <num>` | Number of packets to include after the trigger |
| `-o <file>` | Output PCAP file |
| `-h` | Display help |

### Protocol Manipulators (mfbc, mfile, mpaltalk, mwmail)
These specialized manipulators share a common syntax. **Note: Parameters MUST respect the order shown below.**

```bash
<tool> [-h] [-s] [-l] [-i] [-c <config_file>] -p <port>
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c <file>` | Specify config file |
| `-s` | Silent mode |
| `-p <port>` | Connection port |
| `-i` | Info (PEI generated by this manipulator) |
| `-l` | Print all logs to the screen |
| `-h` | Display help |

*   **mfbc**: Facebook traffic manipulator.
*   **mfile**: File transfer manipulator.
*   **mpaltalk**: Paltalk traffic manipulator.
*   **mwmail**: Webmail traffic manipulator.

## Notes
- Xplico relies on several services including Apache and SQLite. If the Web UI fails to start, check if port 80 or 9876 is already in use.
- The tool is "data-centric," meaning it organizes output by "Cases" and "Sessions" within its internal database.
- For live capture, root privileges (`sudo`) are typically required.
